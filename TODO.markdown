Things that would be nice to have
---------------------------------

* Update the module builder to supply haddocks for commonly used OpenGL bindings
* Add a class for things that can be converted to `GLenum`'s and use it instead of `GLenum` in negative position in the bindings?
* Some of the manual pages are for multiple functions, link by prefix?
* Fix issues on Windows caused by the large number of modules
* Fix distribution issues caused by having a custom `Setup.hs` with non-trivial content.
* Better hyperlinking between modules. We need to know the canonical module in which to find a given method.
