Things that would be nice to have
---------------------------------

* Update the module builder to supply haddocks for commonly used OpenGL bindings
* Add a class for things that can be converted to GLenum's and use it instead of GLenum in negative position in the bindings?
* Some of the manual pages are for multiple functions, link by prefix?
* Link to https://cvs.khronos.org/svn/repos/ogl/trunk/doc/registry/public/specs/
